This repository contains a deep learning project for detecting cancerous vs. non-cancerous skin lesions from medical images using two popular CNN architectures: ResNet and GoogleNet (Inception). The project achieves 80%+ accuracy through hyperparameter optimization.

## üìä Overview

Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer globally. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify skin lesions as either cancerous or non-cancerous using the HAM10000 dataset.

We compare two state-of-the-art architectures:
- **ResNet**: Known for its skip connections that solve the vanishing gradient problem
- **GoogleNet (Inception)**: Features inception modules with parallel convolutional operations

## üî¢ Dataset

The [HAM10000 dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T) (Human Against Machine with 10000 training images) consists of 10,015 dermatoscopic images of pigmented skin lesions. For our binary classification task, we've grouped these into:
- Cancerous lesions
- Non-cancerous lesions

The dataset includes seven different diagnostic categories:
- Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma (akiec)
- Basal cell carcinoma (bcc)
- Benign keratosis-like lesions (bkl)
- Dermatofibroma (df)
- Melanoma (mel)
- Melanocytic nevi (nv)
- Vascular lesions (vasc)

## üß† Models

### ResNet
- Residual Neural Network with skip connections
- Addresses the vanishing gradient problem
- Allows for training much deeper networks

### GoogleNet (Inception)
- Features inception modules with parallel convolutions
- Efficient computation with dimension reduction techniques
- Intermediate classifiers for deeper networks

## ‚ú® Features

- Binary classification of skin lesions (cancerous vs. non-cancerous)
- Implementation of ResNet and GoogleNet architectures
- Hyperparameter optimization for better performance
- Data augmentation to prevent overfitting
- Visualization tools for model evaluation

## üìà Results

The project achieved 80%+ accuracy on the test set with the following evaluation metrics:

- **Accuracy**: 82.7%
- **Precision**: 83.5%
- **Recall**: 81.9%
- **F1-Score**: 82.7%
- **AUC**: 0.89

## üîÑ Hyperparameter Optimization

We explored six key hyperparameters:

1. **Number of epochs**: 30, 50, 100
2. **Learning rate**: 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001
3. **Optimizers**: Adam, SGD, RMSprop
4. **Dropout rate**: 0.2, 0.5, 0.7
5. **Batch size**: 16, 32, 64
6. **Number of convolutional layers**: Varies by architecture variant

### Best Hyperparameter Configuration

The best performance was achieved with:

- **Architecture**: ResNet50
- **Learning rate**: 0.0001
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Dropout rate**: 0.5
- **Batch size**: 32
- **Epochs**: 50
